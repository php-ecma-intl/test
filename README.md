## About

This is a PHP port of the `intl402` test suite for [ECMA-402](https://tc39.es/ecma402/)
from [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262). This port is up-to-date with
Test262, as of the version of Test262 included in this project as a Git
submodule at `./resources/test262`.

Since PHP does not follow the same conventions as JavaScript, PHP code
implementing ECMA-402 will differ from the specification. Where it differs,
this test suite follows the reference implementation for
[pecl/ecma_intl](https://github.com/php-ecma-intl/ext). Polyfills may use
this test suite to ensure compatibility with pecl/ecma_intl.

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating in this project and its community, you are expected to uphold
this code.


## Installation

Install this package as a dependency using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
composer require --dev php-ecma-intl/test
```


## Usage

Use these tests to ensure your polyfill library conforms to the pecl/ecma_intl
implementation of [ECMA-402](https://tc39.es/ecma402/).

To add these tests to your project's test runner, add the following to your
project's `phpunit.xml` or `phpunit.xml.dist` file:

```xml
<testsuites>
    <testsuite name="ecma_intl conformance">
        <directory suffix=".php">./vendor/php-ecma-intl/test/tests</directory>
    </testsuite>
</testsuites>
```

Then, create a file (if you don't already have one) at `tests/Pest.php`, and
add the following to it:

```php
include_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/php-ecma-intl/test/harness/testIntl.php';
```

Now, you may run `vendor/bin/pest --testsuite "ecma_intl conformance"` to
execute the conformance tests provided by this package.
